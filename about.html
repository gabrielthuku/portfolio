      I went to primary school in a place far from home and i don`t know how i really ended up there.

      At this time I was asked the peopl I hate most I would vote for yes to my parents.....naaaaahhh!!!
      I love this guy even after sending me away from home.I was ten by then.I hated the feeling of not seeing 
      my parents but atlist i got to interact with other from far places.</p>
