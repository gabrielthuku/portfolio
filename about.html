      <p>Hey,
        <br>
      My name is Gabriel Makumi and this is me.I was born in Thika town and was raised in another city.
      I went to primary school in a place far from home and i don`t know how i really ended up there.
      Samrose academy was my first boarding school which i joined when i was really young. 
      At this time if I was asked the people I hate most I would vote for yes to my parents.....naaaaahhh!!!
      I love this guys even after sending me away from home.I was ten by then.I hated the feeling of not seeing 
      my parents but atlist i got to interact with other from far places.</p>
