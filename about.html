      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hey,
        <br>
      My name is Gabriel Makumi and this is me.I was born in Thika town and was raised in another city.
      I went to primary school in a place far from home and i don`t know how i really ended up there.
      Samrose academy was my first boarding school which i really joined when i was really young. 
      At this time I was asked the peopl I hate most I would vote for yes to my parents.....naaaaahhh!!!
      I love this guy even after sending me away from home.I was ten by then.I hated the feeling of not seeing 
      my parents but atlist i got to interact with other from far places.</p>
      <p>I graduated to high school and still got to go far away from my from my family to Kirinyaga. At this point 
       I was all grown up and new how to live with me. four years all by myself trying to figure out who i am .
      the funning is until now i have not yet figured what i want to be. <ul>
        <li>I love myself.</li>
        <li>I love and care about my family</li>
        <li>I care about all those who care about  the well being of others. </li>
        <li>And most of all I put God first</li>
        <p>Having visited a many places i have developed many hobbies.I learned how to dance, swimm among other things.
          I have pets. They are german shephards,Tyson and Tasha male and female. In the resent past I joined Moringa School 
        and i am now learning how to become a software devoloper. time never waits and i have to keep up with it .Speaking of
      time, ten years from now i will be twenty nine years old, which i really don't what I will be doing with my life by then. </p>
